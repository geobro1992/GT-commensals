Rogue Creek,winter,W,RCD2,19,19,266,AB,AB,60,Burrow starting to collapse. Coachwhip seen using burrow for 3 days. The first day it was raining and it only hung out at the entrance but did not leave. The next day it is seen leaving the burrow. It was never seen reentering the burrow but the next day a coachwhip is seen leaving the burrow again. Could potentially be a second coachwhip? The first day while it was raining there was what i think is a baby squirrel crawling around the apron. It must have fallen out of a tree and it appears to not have it's eyes open yet. It eventually crawls right up to the coachwhip which then eats it!
